A tutor scheduling application meant to provide free tutoring services by university students 

Uses Client-side React.js along with a Django REST Framwork backend. 

Uses Knox for authentication, Django's vanilla ORM, and local storage authentication (will fix to cookie or JWT, proabbly never. I'm sorry)

React client uses MaterialUI for styling, React Router for Client-side routing, and axios for fetching.
